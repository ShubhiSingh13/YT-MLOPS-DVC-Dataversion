create git repo and clone it in local.
create code.py and add code to it. (it'll save a csv file to a new "data" folder)
Do a git add-commit-push before initializing dvc.
#pip install dvc
Now we'll do "dvc init" (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
Now do "mkdir S3" (creates new directory)
Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"
Next "dvc add data/"
    Now it'll ask to do : ("git rm -r --cached 'data' " and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
    because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
Now - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first verson of data.
Now make changes to mycode.py to append a new row in a data, check changes via "dvc status"
Again - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
